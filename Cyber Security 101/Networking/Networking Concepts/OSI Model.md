# OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

**Purpose:** A conceptual framework that explains how data moves through a network from physical hardware to user-facing applications.

**Mnemonic (Layer 1 -> 7):**

---

## Layer 7 - Application
- **Function:** Provides network services directly to applications
- **Think:** What the user interacts with
- **Examples:** HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, SMTP, IMAP, POP3

---

## Layer 6 - Presentation
- **Function:** Data formatting, encoding, encryption, and compression
- **Think:** Making data readable and secure
- **Examples:** Unicode, ASCII, MIME, JPEG, PNG, MPEG, TLS/SSL

---

## Layer 5 - Session
- **Function:** Establishes, maintains, and synchronizes communication sessions
- **Think:** Managing conversations between systems
- **Examples:** NFS, RPC

---

## Layer 4 - Transport
- **Function:** End-to-end communication, segmentation, reliability
- **Think:** How data is delivered
- **Examples:** TCP, UDP

---

## Layer 3 - Network
- **Function:** Logical addressing and routing between networks
- **Think:** Finding the best path across networks
- **Examples:** IP, ICMP, IPSec

---

## Layer 2 - Data Link
- **Function:** Reliable data transfer within the same network segment
- **Think:** MAC addresses and local delivery
- **Examples:** Ethernet (802.3), WiFi (802.11)

---

## Layer 1 - Physical
- **Function:** Transmits raw bits over a physical medium
- **Think:** Cables and signals
- **Examples:** Copper cables, fiber optics, radio waves

---

## Quick Mental Model
- **Layers 1-3:** Move data
- **Layer 4:** Deliver data
- **Layers 5-7:** Make data usable
