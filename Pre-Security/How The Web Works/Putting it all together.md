# Putting it all together

## Load Balancers
- handle **high traffic** + **failover**
- user hits load balancer → LB forwards to best server
- algorithms: **round-robin**, **least-busy (weighted)**
- **health checks** stop traffic to bad servers

## CDN (Content Delivery Network)
- hosts **static files** (JS, CSS, images, videos)
- files served from nearest location → **faster + reduces load**

## Databases
- store/recall user data
- types: **MySQL, MSSQL, MongoDB, Postgres**
- can be single file → multi-server clusters

## WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- sits between user + webserver
- blocks hacking attempts + DoS
- checks for attacks, bots, rate-limits requests
- drops suspicious traffic before the server sees it

## What Is a Web Server
- software that listens for connections + serves content via **HTTP**
- common: **Apache, Nginx, IIS, NodeJS**
- serves files from **root directory**  
  - Linux: `/var/www/html`  
  - Windows IIS: `C:\inetpub\wwwroot`
- URL path maps to file path (e.g., `/picture.jpg` → that file in root)

## Virtual Hosts
- lets one server host **multiple websites**
- server checks **Host header** → matches config → serves correct site
- each site can have its **own root directory**
- unlimited number of sites

## Static vs Dynamic Content
- **Static** = never changes (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- **Dynamic** = changes per request (blogs, searches, dashboards)
- dynamic content generated by **backend** → HTML sent to browser (frontend)

## Backend / Server-Side Languages
- create dynamic pages, process user input, talk to databases
- common: **PHP, Python, Ruby, NodeJS, Perl**
- backend code is **not visible** to users (browser only gets final HTML)

## Example (PHP)
Request: `/index.php?name=adam`

Backend:
```php
<html><body>Hello <?php echo $_GET["name"]; ?></body></html>
```

Browser receives:
```html
<html><body>Hello adam</body></html>
